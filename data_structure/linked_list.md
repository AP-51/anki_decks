###### Question 1.
What is a linked list? How does it differ from an array? (2)

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. In contrast to arrays, elements in a linked list are not stored in contiguous memory locations.

The main differences between a linked list and an array are:

Memory Allocation:
In arrays, memory is allocated in a contiguous block, while in linked lists, each element can be stored anywhere in memory, with the address of the next element stored in the node.

Size:
Arrays have a fixed size, whereas linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically.

Access Time:
In arrays, elements can be accessed directly by their index, while in linked lists, you have to traverse the list from the beginning to access an element.
