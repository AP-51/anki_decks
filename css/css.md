Question 3.
What are the three primary ways to include CSS styles in a HTML document?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
The three primary ways to include CSS styles in a HTML document are inline styles, internal styles, and external styles. Inline styles are applied directly to a HTML element using the style attribute, internal styles are defined within a < style > element in the HTML's < head >, and external styles are stored in separate CSS files linked to the HTML document.

Question 4.
Question: What are CSS selectors and how do they work?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements. They define the elements to which a set of CSS rules should be applied. Selectors can target elements based on their type, class, ID, attributes, and more.

For example:

Element Selector: Targets specific HTML elements. Example: p { color: blue; }
Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class attribute. Example: .my-class { font-weight: bold; }
ID Selector: Targets a single element with a specific ID attribute. Example: #my-id { text-decoration: underline; }
Attribute Selector: Targets elements based on their attribute values. Example: input[type="text"] { background-color: #f0f0f0; }
Selectors can also be combined to create more specific and targeted styles.
